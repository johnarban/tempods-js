      The colors represent the fire's radiative power (FRP), which is a measure of the heat energy released by the fire, expressed in megawatts (MW).
      Higher FRP values often indicate more intense burning within a group of fire pixels, though these values can vary depending on imaging conditions.
      If FRP data isn't available for a location, a placeholder value is used.
